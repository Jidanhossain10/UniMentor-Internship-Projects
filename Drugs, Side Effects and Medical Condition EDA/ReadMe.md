# 💊 Drug Ratings & Side Effects Analysis

This project analyzes drug ratings, side effects, and medical conditions to uncover patterns in patient experiences and drug effectiveness. The analysis is based on a structured dataset and visualized using Python and Excel.

## 📁 Project Structure
drugs_side_effects_drugs_com.csv # Raw dataset;
drug_analysis_charts.xlsx # Excel charts with embedded conclusions;
drug_analysis.py # Python script for data analysis and chart export

## ✅ Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Python (Pandas).
- Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.
- Standardized key fields such as `rating`, `side_effects`, and `drug_classes`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed data grouping and aggregation in Python.
- Generated visualizations for:
  - Distribution of drug ratings
  - Top-reviewed drugs for common conditions (Acne, Hypertension, Pain)
  - Most frequently reported side effects
  - Top-rated drug classes
  - Box plot showing rating distribution per condition

### 3. Excel Reporting
- Exported all Python-generated visualizations to an Excel workbook.
- Designed a clean layout with:
  - Embedded charts
  - Descriptive conclusion text beside each chart
  - Hyperlinked icon to Python script for code traceability

## 📊 Key Insights

- ⭐ **Most drug ratings cluster between 7–10**, showing general patient satisfaction.
- 💬 **Common side effects** include nausea, dizziness, and headache.
- 🔬 **Pain medications show high variability** in user ratings, likely due to personal response differences.
- 🧪 **Top-rated drug classes** include well-established medications like NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors.
- 🌍 **Acne and Hypertension treatments** receive the most reviews, reflecting high user engagement and concern.
